### Step 1: Avenues for coming up with an idea
* What problem do you have in your everyday life that you would like to solve?
* What are you passionate about?

### Step 2: Working on the Overview
* Brainstorm about what kind of features you would like to have, write them down as you think of it, example:

A user can fill out a form where you can create a recipe with instructions on how to create and ingredients added to the recipe. A user can list out the recipes and select the recipe they may want to like or comment on. A user can delete their own recipes and edit their own recipes as well.

### Step 3: List out all of the features
* Form to create Recipe (submit, post): MVP
* List out recipes (DOMContentLoaded, get): MVP
* A user can like a recipe (click, patch): Stretch goal
* A user can comment on a recipe (submit, post): Stretch goal
* A user can delete their recipe (click, delete): MVP
* A user can edit their recipe (search, patch): Stretch goal
* A user can search their recipes (submit): Stretch goal

MVP: MUST BE ADDED
STRETCH GOALS: QUALITY OF LIFE UPDATES

### Step 4: Come up with an MVP (Project Requirements)
* Form to create recipe (submit)
* List out recipes (DOMContentLoaded)
* A user can delete their recipe (click)

### Step 5: Listing out your stretch goals
* A user can edit their recipe (search)
* A user can search their recipes (submit)
* A user can like a recipe (click)
* A user can comment on a recipe (submit)
